## Functionalities 

1. **Shutdown functionality:** Shut the Pi down safely when the button is pressed. The Pi now consumes zero power.
1. **Wake functionality:** Turn the Pi back on when the button is pressed again.

## Hardware
1. Normally open (NO) power button, some jumper wires
1. Connect the power button to Pin 5 (GPIO 3/SCL) and Pin 6 (GND)
  1. For Rasp Pi 4 b  (current one FisherFactory) Pin 5 (GPIO 9/SCL) and Pin 6 (GND) works with following script

## Install
1. Connect to Rasp Pi with SSH
1. Download Git if necessary 'sudo apt-get install git'
1. Clone GitHub repository `git clone https://github.com/Howchoo/pi-power-button.git`
1. Run the setup script: `./pi-power-button/script/install`
1. Now the start-stop button should work

## Uninstallation
If you need to uninstall the power button script in order to use GPIO3 for another project or something:

1. Run the uninstall script: `./pi-power-button/script/uninstall`

## Status indicator LED Raspberry Pi
Used link: https://howchoo.com/pi/build-a-simple-raspberry-pi-led-power-status-indicator/
To indicate if the Pi is running or not, a LED is added. The green LED turns on when the Pi is completely running (not booting). And it will turn off when the Pi is completely inactive. 
### Hardware
1. Green LED 2.2V
1. Resistor 100Î© connected to the positive 
1. Connect the positive of the LED to the TxD pin (GPIO 14)
1. Connect the negative of the LED to the ground

### Software
1. Connect to Rasp Pi and open config.txt `suda nano /boot/config.txt`
1. Add the following line: `enable_uart=1`
1. Reboot the Pi 'sudo reboot'
